# 🛰 Privacy-Enhanced Messaging Metadata Defense Prototype  
### Reducing Routing Metadata Leakage in E2EE Messaging Systems  

---

## Introduction

Even though modern messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram protect message content using End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), they still leak **routing metadata — such as sender, recipient, timestamp, and message size.  
Attackers or service providers can analyze this metadata to infer communication patterns, social graphs, or even who talks to whom.  

Our project presents a working prototype that introduces adaptive privacy layers to obscure such metadata without sacrificing delivery performance.  
It combines simulation, AI-driven attacker evaluation, and real-time reasoning using Pathway and LLM intelligence.
